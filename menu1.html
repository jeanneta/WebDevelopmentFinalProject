		<h3>What is Mental Health</h3>
		<img src="media/mentalhealth4.jpg">

		<p>
			According to the World Health Organization (WHO):
			“Mental health is a state of well-being in which an individual realizes his or her own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively, and is able to make a contribution to his or her community.”


		</p>
		<p>
			Mental health includes emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make healthy choices. Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood.
		</p>
		<p>
			Mental and physical health are equally important components of overall health.  Mental illness, especially depression, increases the risk for many types of physical health problems, particularly long-lasting conditions like stroke, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease. 
		</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Types of mental illness?</h3>
		<img src="media/mentalhealth2.jpg">

		<p>
			Mental illnesses are of different types and degrees of severity. Some of the major types are depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, bipolar mood disorder,personality disorders, and eating disorders.
		</p>
		<p>
			The most common mental illnesses are anxiety and depressive disorders. While everyone experiences strong feelings of tension, fear, or sadness at times. people with a depressive disorder may not be able to get out of bed or care for themselves physically. People with certain types of anxiety disorder may not be able to leave the house, or may have compulsive rituals to help them alleviate their fears.
		</p>
		<p>
			Less common are mental illnesses that may involve psychosis. These include schizophrenia and bipolar mood disorder. People experiencing an acute episode of psychosis lose touch with reality and perceive their world differently from normal. Their ability to make sense of thoughts, feelings and the world around them is seriously affected.
		</p>
		<h3>Treatment of mental illness</h3>
		<img src="media/mentalhealth3.jpg">

		<p>
			Effective treatments can include medication, cognitive and behavioural psychological therapies, psycho-social support, psychiatric disability rehabilitation,avoidance of risk factors such as harmful alcohol and other drug use, and learning self-management skills.
		</p>
		<p>
			People with mental illness may be at risk of harmful alcohol and other drug use. The risk of suicide is heightened for people with some mental illnesses, particularly soon after diagnosis or release from hospital.
		</p>
		<p>
			A psychotic episode may involve delusions, such as false beliefs of persecution, guilt, or grandeur. It may involve hallucinations, where the person sees, hears, smells, or tastes things that are not there.
